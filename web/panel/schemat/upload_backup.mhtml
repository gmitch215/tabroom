					pattern of software users everywhere, and actually read this
					cautionary note.

					Please, only use this to upload Tabroom.com data that you've
					downloaded from a round from <span class="inline semibold redtext">THIS tournament</span>.

					This backup only works inside the SAME tournament and
					will not go through and un-delete competitors, judges
					or schools, or sync entries from another tournament.
					That's under Register &rarr; Data.

				<p title="Just ask Jim Menick">
					If you try to upload a full tournament backup or a CSV
					file or a copy of your 8th grade report card or
					whatever else, it will not work and might delete other
					data.  We will have a very limited ability to help you,
					and a very high propensity to laugh at you.
