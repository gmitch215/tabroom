			<h4>Need help?</h4>

			<p>

				If you're a student, coach, or parent and have a question about
				a particular tournament, <span class='inline semibold'>email
				them directly</span> - they're more likely to be able to help
				you. Contact information can usually be found in the tournament
				invitation or main website here.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you're having trouble using the Tabroom software itself, try
				the manual using the question mark in the top right corner, or
				here:
			</p>

			<a href="https://docs.tabroom.com" class="yellow full">
				Tabroom Documentation
			</a>

			<p>
				If those don't work or your question deals with something
				private (e.g. personal student info, access needs) email us at
			</p>

			<a href="mailto:help@tabroom.com" class="yellow full">
				help@tabroom.com
			</a>

			<p>
				Please be sure to include as much detail as you can about the
				tournament, event, entry, school or round affected, as well as
				the particular URL of the page you're having trouble with.
			</p>

			<p>
				To run a tournament on Tabroom, log in and hit "Request a
				tournament" on the right hand toolbar.  The how-to guide is
				available from the question mark icon on the top right corner.
				No approval, pre-notification or cost is required to register
				or tabulate a tournament on Tabroom.
